            <h3>Use Profanity</h3>
            
            <p>The easiest way you can help out is just by using Profanity and sending any feedback you have to the <a id="link-mailinglist" href="https://lists.notraces.net/mailman/listinfo/profanity" target="_blank">mailing list</a>.
            Any feedback is welcome, although please keep it polite, and refrain from using profanity (pun intended).</p>
            <p>See <a href="issues.html">Reporting issues</a> for information on where and how to report issues, and how to supply logs/debug information.</p>

            <h3>Help with the website</h3>
            
            <p>The website often has small errors or omissions in documentation etc. The website source is also <a id="link-websitesource" href="https://github.com/profanity-im/profanity-im.github.io" target="_blank">available at github</a> so feel free to send pull requests there.</p>
            <p>We're always interested to hear about profanity being used in different environments, and if you have any screenshots, we'd be happy to post them at the website.</p>

            <p>Yes, the rumors are true. Developers also have to eat. They also have limited time.</p>
            <p>And yet some of them decide to use their free time to develop free software.</p>
            <p>If you want to say "Thank You", please consider <a href="donate.html">donating</a>.</p>
