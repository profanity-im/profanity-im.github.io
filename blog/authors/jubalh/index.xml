      <title>Contributing a Patch via GitHub</title>

      <description>Several people mentioned in our MUC that they have problems contributing code to the Profanity repo on GitHub because &amp;ldquo;forking all the time is cumbersome&amp;rdquo;.
Let me show you an example workflow. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s cumbersome at all. I assume you have an account on GitHub and are logged in. First thing we do is fork the repo. So go to https://github.com/profanity-im/profanity and click on &amp;ldquo;Fork&amp;rdquo;. Now you should be at your fork, in my case this is: https://github.</description>

      <description>From 10th to 14th February 2020 we had Hackweek 19 at SUSE. Part of that time I used to finally implement the long (since 2016!) sought after Last Message Correction feature, aka XEP-0308.
See my Hackweek project and the corresponding pull request.
Usage To enable incoming and outgoing corrections users need to enable it with /correction on, see /help correction for more details.
Now we write a message to a friend /msg Martin Hey therr!</description>

      <description>On 2012-02-02 the first commit to Profanity was done by @boothj5. So now Profanity is already 8 years old! Happy Birthday!
As a present we release today the next version: 0.8.0! It&amp;rsquo;s released five months after 0.7.0 and has 295 commits since then.
Also more and more people contribute to Profanity&amp;rsquo;s development. A big thanks to: @paulfariello, @svensp, @aaptel, @aszlig, @mdosch, @pasis, @mzagozen, @quite, @weiss, @Misaflo and @jubalh.
