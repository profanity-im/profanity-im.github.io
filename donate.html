            <h3>Donating</h3>
            <p>Yes, the rumors are true. Developers also have to eat. They also have limited time.</p>
            <p>And yet some of them decide to use their free time to develop free software.</p>
            <p>You can help the development of Profanity and show your appreciation by donating.<br>
            There are several ways to do so:</p>
            <p>1. Become a sponsor on <a href="https://github.com/jubalh">GitHub Sponsors</a><br>
            2. Write an email to jubalh@iodoru.org to ask for bank details<br>
            3. Send Bitcoin to: bc1qx265eat7hfasqkqmk9qf38delydnrnuvzhzy0x</p>
